# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate software engineer with 5 years of working experience. I created a wine cellar management tool using C# .NET and Angular. My tool should help wine cellar owners (natural or electronic) to manage their stock as well as the conservation of ageing wines. Sometimes I work on containerising applications that do not have a docker or OCI image.'
